# **HubStack AI CIDAR Challenge Solution**

## üöÄ **Overview**
HubStack AI delivers a **cutting-edge passive imaging solution** for the **Computational Imaging Detection and Ranging (CIDAR) Challenge**, a **DARPA initiative** designed to advance **high-precision, low-latency passive ranging technology**. Our approach leverages **multi-spectral fusion, deep learning, and hardware-aware optimizations** to surpass **traditional depth estimation limitations**, enabling **stealthy, real-time, and long-range distance measurement** in complex environments.

### **üìå What is the CIDAR Challenge?**
Traditional **active ranging systems** (e.g., **LADAR, LRF**) emit laser signals, making them **detectable, vulnerable to jamming, and restricted in stealth operations**. In contrast, **passive imaging** relies solely on ambient light and environmental cues, offering **undetectable, low-power, and resilient ranging capabilities**‚Äîideal for **ISR, autonomous navigation, and battlefield awareness**. DARPA's **CIDAR Challenge** seeks **next-generation passive ranging solutions** that rival or surpass **active methods** while **minimizing computational complexity (FLOPs) for real-time deployment**. Current passive imaging techniques extract only **~1% of the available distance information** in images. By integrating **multi-spectral fusion, deep learning, and adaptive filtering**, CIDAR aims to **increase accuracy by 10x‚Äì100x**, unlocking **precision passive rangefinding beyond 10 km**‚Äîa breakthrough for **defense, surveillance, and autonomous systems**.

### **üéØ Desired Outcomes for the Department of Defense (DOD)**

   - This increases **tactical effectiveness** in **rapid decision-making scenarios**.

3. **Reduced Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) & Cost**  
   - Advanced **software-driven range detection** reduces reliance on **bulky, power-hungry hardware**.  
   - CIDAR-based solutions provide a **lighter, more efficient, and cost-effective** alternative for **DOD operations**.

4. **Improved Access to Civil Airspace**  
   - **Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)** require **safer navigation** in civil airspace.  
   - CIDAR enables **passive-only sense-and-avoid (SAA) solutions**, facilitating **non-cooperative air traffic detection**.

5. **Enhancing Transportation & Safety**  
   - CIDAR improves **autonomous vehicle algorithms** by overlaying **real-time range data** onto images.
