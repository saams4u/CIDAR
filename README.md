# **HubStack AI CIDAR Challenge Solution**

## 🚀 **Overview**
HubStack AI, Inc. presents a **state-of-the-art passive imaging solution** for the **Computational Imaging Detection and Ranging (CIDAR) Challenge**, a **DARPA initiative** aimed at revolutionizing **high-accuracy, low-latency passive range measurement algorithms**.

### **📌 What is the CIDAR Challenge?**
Traditional **active ranging methods**, such as **LADAR (Laser Detection and Ranging) and LRF (Laser Range Finding)**, rely on emitted laser radiation, which can **compromise stealth, pose safety hazards, and be susceptible to detection or jamming**. **Passive imaging**, in contrast, does not emit signals, making it inherently undetectable and more secure for **intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and sense-and-avoid (SAA) applications**.

DARPA's **CIDAR Challenge** seeks **passive ranging algorithms** that can **match or exceed** the performance of active systems while minimizing **floating-point operations (FLOPs)** for **low-latency, real-time processing**. Current passive imaging approaches capture **only ~1% of the theoretical distance information** available in images. By integrating **spatial, spectral, and temporal filtering**, CIDAR aims to **increase accuracy by 10x–100x**, potentially enabling **passive rangefinding at distances beyond 10 km**—a capability that would revolutionize **autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and military reconnaissance**.

### **🎯 Desired Outcomes for the Department of Defense (DOD)**
The **CIDAR Challenge** plays a crucial role in advancing **national defense and civilian applications**, offering **key advantages** over traditional active ranging systems:

1. **Beyond Active Ranging Limitations**  
   - Current **active ranging systems** for ISR **emit detectable radiation**, putting operators at risk.  
   - CIDAR enables a **zero-emission passive ranging solution**, making ISR operations stealthier.

2. **Operational Superiority on the Battlefield**  
   - **High-accuracy passive rangefinding** supports **faster targeting** with **minimal response time** for adversaries.  
   - This increases **tactical effectiveness** in **rapid decision-making scenarios**.

3. **Reduced Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) & Cost**  
   - Advanced **software-driven range detection** reduces reliance on **bulky, power-hungry hardware**.  
   - CIDAR-based solutions provide a **lighter, more efficient, and cost-effective** alternative for **DOD operations**.

4. **Improved Access to Civil Airspace**  
   - **Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)** require **safer navigation** in civil airspace.  
   - CIDAR enables **passive-only sense-and-avoid (SAA) solutions**, facilitating **non-cooperative air traffic detection**.

5. **Enhancing Transportation & Safety**  
   - CIDAR improves **autonomous vehicle algorithms** by overlaying **real-time range data** onto images.  
   - **Augmented reality systems** benefit from precise **depth perception**, improving **situational awareness** for drivers and operators.
